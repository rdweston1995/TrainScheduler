# TrainScheduler

This site will allow a user to create a table of train schedules. The user will be prompted to provide the name of the route and its destination. What time the first train leaves for the route in military time and how often after that time there will be another train. That information will be stored in a firebase database and when a new train is added to the database or on page load the page will request that information from the database to be added to the table of routes on the page. Along with the name, destination, and frequency of the route the table will also display the time of arrival of the next train and the time remaining till that train arrives. 

I had some trouble with moment.js and getting the current time in a usable form. The route I took to make it usable with parsing the string into a substring with just the information I want and then parsing that string to an int. I did the same thing to change the time provided from the user for the beginning of the route to make that usable. I can't help but feel that this is a really long way to get the information that I was looking for. That the documentation for moment.js could provide a better way to get the current time and then the time till the next train. I could also look into adding an updating function on a timer so that time on the page till the next train will be updated the longer the user stays on the page. Adding the ability to remove train schedules from the table and the database.
